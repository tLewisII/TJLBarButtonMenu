<h1>TJLBarButtonMenu</h1>
A simple 3 button menu with a nice presentation and dismissal animation that is meant to be launched from a bar button item.<br>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<hr>
Use [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org), `pod 'TJLBarButtonMenu', '1.0.0'`, or just grab the source folder and drop it into your project.
<h2>Usage</h2>
<hr>
`+initWithViewController:images:buttonTitles:position:`<br>
`-setButtonTappedBlock:`<br>
`-show`<br>
**and thats it!**

Currently the view only supports 2 or 3 images, it looks best with 3. Both top-left and top-right sides of the screen are currently available,
and I may add support for bottom left and bottom right as well.

The button titles are set for the buttons `disabled` state, and are only used to let you know which button was tapped,
so button titles should follow their purpose, as you will get sent the title of the tapped button.

Auto layout is also used, so all interface orientations and rotations are supported.
